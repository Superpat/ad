# ad editor (Rust version)

Starting off by following [this guide][0] for writing a tiny text editor
and then building from there in C over at [ad (C version)][1].
The idea being that if I get this working as a super simple C program as
a starting point then I can port to Rust and then start working on more
features (or just stick in C as a fun learning experience).
