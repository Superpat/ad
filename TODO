:: TODO

 [ ] Mouse support
- [ ] implement remaining text objects
- [ ] store "desired x" or an "x is at EOL" flag?
- [ ] Better colors for the status bar
  - Maybe change the color based on the mode?
- [ ] FUSE filesystem fun...!
- [ ] mini-buffer tab complete
- [ ] completion of command mode commands
  - To start with this should be simple enough for handling just what is built in
    but supporting listing external scripts and tools would be nice as well
- [ ] Scroll off / scroll while maintaining cursor position
- [ ] window splitting
  - This is one where I don't know if I definitely want it or not?
  - It might be better to just rely on tmux but then that forces me into the multi
    process route with a server/client model rather than a single editor and then
    the filesystem stuff for external programs to _extend_ functionality.
    In the client/server model then _everything_ needs to be RPC...which might be
    ok given the current `Action` driven model? The main issue becomes where the
    buffer state lives and how thin the client is.
