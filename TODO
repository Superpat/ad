- [!] Fix keyboard driven scrolling
  - The decision to not drag the cursor while scrolling with the mouse seems to have
    completely broken auto-scrolling.
- [ ] Implement Sam style structural regex
- [ ] implement remaining text objects
  - Target character
  - Delimited between a given character pair
- [ ] store "desired x" or an "x is at EOL" flag?
- [ ] FUSE filesystem fun...!
  - Whether or not this uses FUSE in the end or not, the Acme style interface for
    supporting extension of the editor is still the plan for how to handle things.
- [ ] mini-buffer tab complete
- [ ] completion of command mode commands
  - To start with this should be simple enough for handling just what is built in
    but supporting listing external scripts and tools would be nice as well
