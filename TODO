:: TODO

- [x] Display pending keys in the RHS of the message bar
- [x] sign/number column
- [x] Mini-buffer
  - This will replace the current prompt functionality as the primary way
    for the user to provide commands to the editor other than Normal mode
- [ ] Better colors for the status bar
  - Maybe change the color based on the mode?
- [x] Command mode
  - This probably needs to be a special case that works more like
    the current prompt mode?
  - Actually...this probably wants to be more like the emacs mini-buffer?
    - If I do it that way, then the "default" mini-buffer is just a single
      line but it should be possible to show more detail either above (like
      kakoune) or below (like emacs).
- [ ] Port over the normal mode actions from poe
  - This will require rewriting the impls as they depend on rope data structures
- [x] Search
- [x] Buffer switch
- [x] cwd and cwd manipulation
  - buffer paths should be converted to absolute and displayed relative to cwd
- [x] Opening files from within the editor
- [ ] clipboard support
  - Probably want to look at kakboard for this one / just use xclip & pbcopy
  - true "native" support in ad will require knowing OS specific code
- [ ] FUSE filesystem fun...!
