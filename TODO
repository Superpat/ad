-- BUGS --
- [!] Running format through the 9p interface for larger files can sometimes (but not always)
      result in a crash due to a recv size error? Not sure yet why this then seems to consistently
      work when re-opening the file and retrying the format so it might be something to do with
      cursor position
      > panicked at src/fsys/message.rs:18:19::21:
      > response from main thread: RecvErrorlength is 11942
- [!] Dragging the cursor back over itself is broken in a way I don't fully understand
      yet.
- [!] buffer details for the initial scratch file seem to cause errors when requesting
      the control file details through fsys?
      - Also seems to happen with a new file that is being created
      - It _might_ be something to do with special handling around naming new files?

-- Misc / Editor features --
- [ ] regex engine: support non-caputuring groups
- [ ] regex engine: support named capture groups
- [ ] split apart the Regex itself and a Matcher struct which is what needs to be mutable
      - The matcher can be reused if needed or used as a oneshot for the common case of
        constructing a regex and then using it before throwing it away
- [ ] jump via exec programs should be in the jump list
- [ ] ending dot following exec "x/.../" should be the final match not from
      the end of the match to the end of the file
- [ ] store "desired x" or an "x is at EOL" flag?
- [ ] mini-buffer tab complete
- [ ] completion of command mode commands
      - To start with this should be simple enough for handling just what is built in
        but supporting listing external scripts and tools would be nice as well
- [ ] support opening and navigating directories
- [ ] support using the minibuffer as a dmenu-like feature exposed through the
      filesystem interface

-- Fsys --
- [ ] sed edit in place doesn't seem to work because it needs to be able to create temp
      files right next to the file that is being edited.
      - "cat mnt/buffers/1/body | sed 's/test/TEST/' >mnt/buffers/1/body" just truncates
        the file but this is normal behaviour for sed so not an issue with ad
- [ ] decide on the event format for the events file and implement the events file
- [ ] add top level logfile calling out:
  - buffer open
  - buffer close
  - buffer save
  - change of active buffer
- [ ] need per buffer/directory '+errors' style buffer that can also operate something like
      vim's quickfix list (possibly need a top level one as well then?)

-- Structural regular expressions --
- [ ] Piping through a shell command
- [ ] Replace without output from a shell command
- [ ] Look at running grouped expressions in parallel a-la Sam
      - This should be doable by pre-computing the match positions and tracking any edit
        offsets that have built up
- [ ] Storing the history of previous edit commands and allowing for cycling through
      them would be helpful (same for Command mode).
