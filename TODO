-- Misc / Editor features --
- [ ] split apart the Regex itself and a Matcher struct which is what needs to be mutable
      - The matcher can be reused if needed or used as a oneshot for the common case of
        constructing a regex and then using it before throwing it away

-- Structural regular expressions --
- [ ] Piping through a shell command
- [ ] Replace without output from a shell command
- [ ] Look at running grouped expressions in parallel a-la Sam
      - This should be doable by pre-computing the match positions and tracking any edit
        offsets that have built up
- [ ] Storing the history of previous edit commands and allowing for cycling through
      them would be helpful (same for Command mode).
