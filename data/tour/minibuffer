you also have control over the minibuffer:

    - ad's minibuffer is inspired by dmenu: https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/

    - it can be used to interactively select from newline delimited text

        ../lib/ad.sh:/minibufferSelect/

        minibuffer-demo.sh

    - when combined with the rest of the filesystem interface you have a rich
      starting point for writing your own text-based user interface extensions
      for ad
