we have been using some helper programs already:

    - the NextSlide and PrevSlide commands we have been using to navigate this presentation
      are written using the shell script library shown on the previous slide

    - a more advanced helper script is ../bin/rust-check

    - this makes use of the buffer events file to intercept and re-interpret Load and Execute
      events to provide a custom text driven interface
