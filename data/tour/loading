loading text within ad:

    - as we saw on the last slide, it is possible to open files by interacting with paths found
      inside of ad buffers.

    - there are two ways to "Load" a file in this way:

        - right click on the path with your mouse
        - place the cursor on the path and hit Enter on your keyboard

    - "Loading" within ad is a contextual operation that you have control over.

        ../../src/editor/actions.rs:/default_load_dot/

    - the default plumbing rules (../plumbing.rules) support viewing man pages within ad

        - try loading the following text to view the man page for ls.
        - you will need to highlight the text first before you can load it which can be done
          using the "x" motion in Normal mode.
        
                    ls(1)
