editor modes:

    - ad supports a number of different modes which alter how you interact with the editor

        - Normal mode, where typing selects and manipulates text

        - Insert mode, where typing inserts text into the current buffer

        - Command mode, where you can specify commands for the editor to execute

        - Run mode, where you can run external programs

        - Edit mode, where you can execute editing commands against the current buffer

    - unlike vi, ad's motions in Normal mode follow a "noun + verb" model as in kakoune
      rather than the "verb + noun" model you might expect.

        - you can view the keymap in the ../../src/mode/normal.rs file by right clicking on
          the filepath above or placing your cursor on it and pressing Enter.
