executing text within ad:

    - there are two ways to "Execute" text:

        - middle click on the selection with your mouse
        - place the cursor on the selection and hit "@" on your keyboard

    - some examples:

          Edit , s/mouse/clicky thing/g
          ls ../../
          <date

    - output from commands will go to a buffer named "$dir/+output" by default
