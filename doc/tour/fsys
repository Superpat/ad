ad has a virtual filesystem interface:

    - ad makes use of the 9p file protocol to present a virtual filesystem interface

        http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/5/

    - if you have the 9p(1) command line utility installed you can explore the filesystem
      using the following commands from a shell. (Trying to read control files from within
      ad itself can cause things to lock up)
      
        9p ls ad
        9p ls ad/buffers/1
        9p read ad/buffers/1/dot

    - if you have the fusermount(1) and 9pfuse(4) programs installed then you can set the
      "auto-mount" property in ../../data/init.conf to true in order to mount the virtual
      filesystem directly at ~/.ad/mnt
