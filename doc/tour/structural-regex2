structural regular expressions let you drill down:

    - rather than write a single expression, you describe the process to search
      for the text you are looking for

    - ad supports a scripted mode:

        ad -e $EDIT_SCRIPT ...
        ad -f $FILE_CONTAINING_EDIT_SCRIPT ...

        ad -f ../../examples/scripts/fancy_impl_blocks.ad ../../src/trie.rs
