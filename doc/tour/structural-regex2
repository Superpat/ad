structural regular expressions let you drill down:

    - while the syntax is still regex (so no claims on being easy to read!) it allows you to
      gradually narrow down the text you are searching through and manipulating

    - ad supports a scripted mode via "ad -e $EDIT_SCRIPT" or "ad -f $FILE_CONTAINING_EDIT_SCRIPT"
      which allows you to use it in command line text processing

    - see the ../../examples/scripts/fancy_impl_blocks.ad script for an example of what is possible!

    - you can run the script by executing the following line:

        ad -f ../../examples/scripts/fancy_impl_blocks.ad ../../src/trie.rs
