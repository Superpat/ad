welcome to ad: an adaptable text editor.

    - https://github.com/sminez/ad

    - you can get set up by cloning the repo and running the following commands:
      - cargo install --path .
      - make setup-dotfiles

    - from there you can run this presentation yourself by opening the doc/tour directory
      within ad and middle clicking the word "Slide" below or placing the cursor on
      it and typing "@".

                            >> Slide <<

    - middle click or type "@" on the NextSlide and PrevSlide "buttons" to navigate
      the various pages of the tour.

    - as we'll soon see, there isn't anything special about the "buttons" described
      above. within ad buffers, every piece of text is part of your user interface.
