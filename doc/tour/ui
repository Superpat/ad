a quick UI overview:

    - ad is currently a terminal only editor, but as we'll see you are able to customise
      and run ad in pretty much however you see fit.

    - the default user interface is modelled on vi, with line numbers to the left and a
      status bar & command line at the bottom of the screen.

    - like vi, ad is a modal editor with several default modes of operation

    - the current mode is visible in the lower left corner of the window as part of the
      status bar

    - unlike vi, ad also makes use of a number of features from acme to make text within
      each buffer truely powerful
